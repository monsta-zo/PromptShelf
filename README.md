# PromptShelf

**A macOS menu bar app that stacks voice, screenshots, copied text, and files into one seamless AI prompt — then pastes everything in order with a single ⌘V.**

Works with Claude Code, Claude.ai, ChatGPT, Gemini, Cursor, Windsurf, Zed — anywhere you can type. No integrations. No plugins. No API keys.

## Features

**🎤 Voice Input** — Speak naturally. Your words are transcribed in real-time and stacked as a prompt chunk.

**📋 Clipboard Capture** — Any text or image you copy during a session is automatically added. No extra steps.

**📸 Screenshot** — `⌘⇧3` / `⌘⇧4` during a session captures directly to your shelf — no file saved to desktop.

**📁 File Drop** — Drag files onto the panel. Pasted as a file URL for web AI tools, or path text for terminals.

**⚡ Smart Paste** — `⌘V` sends everything to your AI in order — voice, images, files, all at once.

**🌍 Multi-language** — 63 speech recognition languages. Add the ones you need from the menu.
